# Single-Cell-Phenotyping-and-Survival-Analysis
An ImageJ toolset for survival and cumulative event analysis in longitudinal live-imaging experiments.
Single-cell survival analysis is a useful approach for understanding factors that contribute to cell health, particularly in cultured neurons. However, this type of analysis can be difficult to perform due to the relatively large number of data acquisition and analysis steps necessary to produce results. The Single Cell Phenotyping and Survival Analysis toolset provides a simplified approach for survival and cumulative event analysis in cultured cells. Implemented entirely with in NIH ImageJ, the toolset contains a guided methodology to track and phenotype single cells in time lapse imaging experiments and to subsequently produce survival and cumulative event plots as well as montaged images following each tracked cell through time. The output figures produced are comparable to those produced by existing dedicated survival analysis software and include basic statistical comparisons. In addition, several methods for data transformation and migration are included in order to aid in expected analyses. In this work, the Single Cell Phenotyping and Survival Analysis toolset is presented and applied to survival and phenotype tracking in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons.
